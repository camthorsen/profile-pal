Fixed lint issues identified by updated linting rules.

### Refactoring

Added `.api.` and `.page.` infixes to all Next.js page and API files.

Fixed lint in boilerplate Next.js code.

Removed settings from `tsconfig.json` where they duplicated the inherited setting.

### Tooling

In `next.config.mjs`: Defined `.api.` and `.page.` infixes for files automatically processed by Next.js.
This distinguishes them from test files and allows the test files to be placed in the `src/pages` directory.
